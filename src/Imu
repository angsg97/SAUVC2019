Initializing IMU code
purpose: 
 - obtain  YawPitchRoll 
           magnetic x y z
           acceleration  x y z
           angular rate x y z
           

How to run the code:
1. download the vectornav library from

 https://www.vectornav.com/docs/default-source/downloads/programming-library/vnproglib-1-1-4.zip?sfvrsn=fe678835_20

2. place SAUVC folder into <root>/cpp/projects

3. open a terminal and change the directory to <root>/cpp/projects/SAUVC

4. To build the code,run the command make

5. to run the example, execute command ./SAUVC to run as a c++ function

6. to run the python code, execute command python python_side.py
